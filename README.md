# Buffalo - Raid buff addon
Buffalo adds a new button for your UI, which will lit up with an icon when someone in your group or raid needs a new buff from you. The assigned groups can be configured, so you can set up which groups you will monitor and what buffs you will do.

You can move the button by pressing Shift while dragging the icon to a desired position.

Buffalo works for WoW Classic and TBC.

## Slash Commands
Buffalo does not need much setup, so there are only a few commands available:

* `/buffalo config` - opens the Group/Buff configuration screen. This can also be done by right-clicking the buff button.
* `/buffalo hide` - hides the Buff button
* `/buffalo show` - shows the Buff button again (yay!)
* `/buffalo version` - shows the current version of Buffalo.


## Note:
This is a Beta version, and there may be bugs. Should you find one, feel free to report it below, together with relevant information, such as:
* What class did you play
* What buff failed
* What realm type (Classic Era, Tbc, WoTLK ...)
* Did you get any errors?


## Not yet implemented:
* Paladin buffs are not yet implemented. I hope to make addon 100% compatible with PallyPower, thus exchanging buffs.
* Addon communication to other instances of Buffalo are not implemented.
* TBC / WotLK


## Hey, that addon reminds me of SmartBuff
It sure does! I have been using SmartBuff for many years, and loved it. But now it seems there isn't a working SmartBuff addon out there.

This addon is not a SmartBuff clone!

Buffalo works differently, and have a stronger focus on party/raid buffing, where SmartBuff worked for everyone - including your Warrior for that Find Herbs buff. Buffalo does not support buffing in combat. This is a limitation implemented by Blizzard, which didn't exist back in the SmartBuff days.
