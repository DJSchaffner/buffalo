# Buffalo version 0.5.0-beta1
_- for Classic Era/SoM and TBC._

## Buffalo v0.5: Introducing Raid Buffing
Version 0.5 of Buffalo enters the realms of the Paladins with an option to centralize buffing assignments. Therefore Buffalo is now running in one of three modes:

**NOTE: THIS IS A BETA AND THERE MIGHT BE BUGS.**
In that case, please let me know, together with what expac you used (Classic Era, SOM or TBC), which class you had problems with and eventual error messages you receive.


## Raid mode 0: Personal buffing mode.
This is the default mode when you are playing Solo or in a 5-man party., and is the same mode used in previous versions of Buffalo as standard.

In personal mode you and you alone decide which groups to buff by simply left-click to enable a buff and right-click ro disable a buff.

When you are in a raid, a promoted character (of same class as you) can switch the addon into Raid Mode. There are two raid modes available: Open Raid Assignments and Closed Raid Assignments.


## Raid mode 1: Raid with Open assignments
In Open Raid Assignments mode the screen changes so you for each group and buff combination can put in a name - the name of the person who is responsible for buffing.

You can still change the buff assignments while in Open Raid mode, and even assign other mages. Changes you make are shared with other mages in the raid (with the addon) and vice versa.


## Raid mode 2: Raid with Closed assignments
This works same way as Open assignments, except that only promoted persons of the same class can change the assignments.

The exception here is the Self buffs: you can still enable / disable your selfie buffs, regardless of raid mode.


## Class configuration
The class configuration screen works independent of raid mode: here you can modify which buffs apply to which classes:

## Generel configuration
The generel configuration option is also independent of raid mode. here you can set:
* The number of people in a group (online, in range and eligible for the buff) before Buffalo will a group buff instead of Single buffing.
* Number of seconds before a warning is written in the local chat (0-120 seconds).
* Scan frequency: faster scans = snappier addon, slower scans = less CPU resources used.
* Display missing buffs in Local Chat (Yes/No)
* Display buffed targers in Local Chat (Yes/No)

You can tick the last two options OFF if the addon messages is too spammy for you.
